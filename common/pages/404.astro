    WRONG TURN?

        We're sorry, but it looks like the page you were trying to visit has
        been misplaced. It's not entirely clear where it's gone, but we suspect
        it may have gotten lost in the vast expanse of the internet.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        We've searched high and low, but alas, we can't seem to find it. It's
        possible that it's hiding behind a particularly stubborn firewall, or
        maybe it's taking a much-needed vacation on a remote server farm.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Despite our best efforts, we just can't seem to locate the page you were
        looking for. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In the meantime, why not take a look around our <a
          class="text-gold-500"
          href="/">homepage</a
        > and see if you can find something else that piques your interest? Who knows,
        you might just stumble upon something even better than what you were originally
        looking for.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for stopping by, and we hope to see you again soon!</p>
