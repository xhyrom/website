****Happy New Year 2025**** ðŸŽ‰

Itâ€™s been a tough year, no doubt about it, but here we are, stepping into **2025** (**7E9**, **11111101001** or **3751**). I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you â€” whether this year was kind to you or not, youâ€™ve made it through, and thatâ€™s worth celebrating. I know some still have almost half a day before the new year, so if you're among them, read this later :)

Hey, life isn't long. Just focus only on the positive stuff in your life. Seriously, whatâ€™s the point of wasting energy on things that make you feel bad? Letâ€™s try to make 2025 your year.

Did you know that **2025** is a pretty cool number? Itâ€™s **45Â²** (20 + 25)Â², which makes it the only perfect square year of this century. The last one, **1936** (**44Â²**), was almost **90** years ago, and the next, **2116** (**46Â²**), is so far off. Oh, and you can also write **2025** as **1Â³ + 2Â³ + 3Â³ + ... + 9Â³**. Each next perfect square year is **nÂ²** is **(n - 1) + n** away from the previous one (nÂ² = (n - 1)Â² + (2n - 1) = nÂ² - 2n + 1 + 2n - 1 = nÂ²) - the difference between them is always **2n - 1**, meaning they're becoming linearly more sparse over the years.

Enjoy the year **2025**. I believe you will achieve what you want.
