              ))

          </ul>

          I'm still learning with some things like Go and Rust, so I don't know
          them perfectly, but I've included them in this list anyway.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Continuous learning is an essential aspect of my professional journey,
          and while I do not claim to be a master of any programming language,
          my expertise in various languages is continually evolving. As a
          contributor and moderator for the <a

          >.

        <p class="my-4">
          My passion for learning and staying up-to-date with the latest
          technologies motivates me to take on new challenges and contribute to
          diverse projects.
